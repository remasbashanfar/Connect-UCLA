## Description

The application is a website for hosting UCLA events.
It acts as a billboard where users can create and post their events for others to see, all in order to make events in the UCLA community accessible in a more centralized manner.
For more information about the process of creating this project, check out theses slides https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qb3CllMVC3zJgQWSLNZ2SlvnrPWLA2zl4yzv5_qLdI/edit?usp=sharing
## Installation

First and foremost, Node.js is required. It can be downlaoded from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

After cloning the repository, packages and their dependencies should be installed.

To do this, in your CLI navigate to the server and
react-connectucla directories (separately) and run:
npm install

> Expect warnings and vulnerabilities for the client (react-connectucla).  
> The server should be installed with no issues. 

**Running the application**

To launch the backend server:
- Open your commandline
- Navigate to ConnectUCLA/server
- run 'node index'

> If you see "listening on port 5000", the server is running.

To launch the client:
- Open your commandline
- Navigate to ConnectUCLA/react-connectucla
- run 'npm start'

> Your browser should open localhost:3000 and you should see the homepage.

### Note

This application is not made for production, as such there are limitations. 
The Google Calendar API will not work locally unless your @g.ucla.edu email is added as a test user (Our TA is added).
The MongoDB database is not hosted locally, it is hosted at cloud.mongodb.com, as such your network needs to allow
communications through the appropirate ports for the server to be able to connect (e.g. UCLA Web does not allow this, Eduroam does).
